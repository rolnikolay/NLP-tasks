# NLP-tasks
This is a space for tasks I have completed during [Natural language processing](https://courses.cs.ut.ee/2020/NLP/spring) at [the University of Tartu](https://majandus.ut.ee/en/admissions/innovation-technology-management-ma)

You need either [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to run these scripts. Or simply view the results here in Github.
